          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity, Age and Poverty</h2>
          <p>For most states, obesity generally increases with age, indicating lack of 
            physcial activity. It is clustered around the ages of 35 to 40, where there 
            is a sharp increase in the rate of obesity. Young adults are usually more involved
            with outdoor activities, keeping them healthy.</p>

          <p>Also, the poverty rate within the states results in an increase in obesity. A large reason for
            this can be attributed to the lack of affordability for healthier options.</p>

          <p>But there are a few exceptions, like in New Hampshire, which has a low poverty rate and has 
            a high obesity rate. It is evident that the trends of obesity, poverty, and age are related,
            and we can extrapolate the data to conclude there would be similar trends when working with 
            household income, healthcare, etc.</p>
